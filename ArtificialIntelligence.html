            <h2>What is Artificial Intelligence?</h2>
            <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the branch of computer science that enables machines to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include learning from experience, understanding languages, recognizing patterns, solving problems, and making decisions.</p>
            <p><strong>Simply put:</strong> AI allows computers and machines to mimic human abilities such as reasoning, learning, and problem-solving. Unlike regular programs, AI systems can adapt and improve over time.</p>
            <p><strong>Examples of AI in daily life include:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Google Maps:</strong> Helps you find the shortest route and traffic updates.</li>
                <li><strong>Virtual Assistants:</strong> Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant respond to your questions and follow voice commands.</li>
                <li><strong>Chatbots:</strong> Automated tools on websites that answer your questions in real-time.</li>
                <li><strong>Face Recognition:</strong> Technology that unlocks your smartphone using your face.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

    <!-- Section 2: History of AI -->
    <section class="history-of-ai">
        <div class="container">
            <h2>The Evolution of Artificial Intelligence</h2>
            <p>The concept of AI has existed for decades. Below is a brief timeline of how AI has evolved over time:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>1950:</strong> Alan Turing proposed the Turing Test, a measure of machine intelligence.</li>
                <li><strong>1956:</strong> John McCarthy coined the term "Artificial Intelligence" during the Dartmouth Conference.</li>
                <li><strong>1960-70s:</strong> Early AI systems focused on problem-solving and basic rule-based systems.</li>
                <li><strong>1980s:</strong> Expert systems emerged, which were programmed to mimic human experts in specific fields.</li>
                <li><strong>1990s-2000s:</strong> Increased computational power and internet availability accelerated AI research.</li>
                <li><strong>2010s-Present:</strong> The rise of <strong>Machine Learning</strong> and <strong>Deep Learning</strong> led to significant AI advancements, such as voice recognition, autonomous vehicles, and recommendation systems.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

    <!-- Section 3: How AI Works -->
    <section class="how-ai-works">
        <div class="container">
            <h2>How Does AI Work?</h2>
            <p>Artificial Intelligence works by processing large amounts of data and using algorithms (step-by-step instructions) to identify patterns and make decisions. AI mainly works in the following steps:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Data Collection:</strong> AI collects large amounts of data from various sources such as sensors, databases, and the internet.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Processing:</strong> The collected data is cleaned, analyzed, and prepared for training.</li>
                <li><strong>Machine Learning:</strong> Using algorithms, AI "learns" from the data. For example, it recognizes patterns or relationships within the data.</li>
                <li><strong>Decision-Making:</strong> Based on the learned patterns, AI makes predictions or decisions, like suggesting a product or driving a car.</li>
                <li><strong>Feedback and Improvement:</strong> AI systems improve over time through feedback and additional data.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>For example, <strong>image recognition AI</strong> analyzes thousands of images to learn how to identify objects like cats or cars. Over time, its accuracy improves as it learns from mistakes.</p>
